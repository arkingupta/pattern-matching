% function which tells us how many of the motifs in the source are present in the target
% output give the number of sequences of the reduced connectivity set which are present in the full connectivity set
% inputs to the function are cell arrays of dynamic sequences
% Bug Fixes:
% 1. Instead of a break when you check m > o, there should be a continue, so that you check the next sequence to see if there is a match.
% 2. We get rid of the m>o check because we would like to know if a percentage of the seq of length m still found a match to the seq of length o
